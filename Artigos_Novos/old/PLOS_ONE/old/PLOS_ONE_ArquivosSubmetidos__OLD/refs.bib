	in networks to be connected to other vertices that are like (or unlike)
	them in some way. We consider mixing according to discrete characteristics
	such as language or race in social networks and scalar characteristics
	such as age. As a special example of the latter we consider mixing
	according to vertex degree, i.e., according to the number of connections
	vertices have to other vertices: do gregarious people tend to associate
	with other gregarious people? We propose a number of measures of
	assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply
	them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative
	mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also
	propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic
	ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based
	on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques. We use these models to
	probe the properties of networks as their level of assortativity
	is varied. In the particular case of mixing by degree, we find strong
	variation with assortativity in the connectivity of the network and
	in the resilience of the network to the removal of vertices.},
