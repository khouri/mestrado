important role in the e-Science. This paper presents the new
functionalities of a SWMS that was originally developed fifteen years
ago. These functionalities are focused on the automatic composition and
execution of workflows, and the transparent use of local applications,
Web Service and Java methods as the building blocks of the scientific
experiments."
